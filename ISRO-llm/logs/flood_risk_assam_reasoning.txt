To assess flood-prone areas in Assam using SRTM elevation and rainfall data from IMD (India Meteorological
Department), follow this Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. Download the SRTM elevation DEM and rainfall data for Assam from the IMD website.
2. Preprocess the SRTM DEM data using WhiteboxTools to remove noise, inconsistencies, and to create hydrologic
parameters such as slope, aspect, flow direction, flow accumulation, hillshade, curvature, and Topographic Wetness
Index (TWI).
3. Interpolate rainfall data using spatial interpolation techniques like Kriging or Inverse Distance Weighted
(IDW) to create a rainfall raster map for Assam.
4. Calculate the probability of a landslide occurrence using the Frequency Ratio (FR) method, taking into account
the combined effects of slope, TWI, and rainfall intensity. The FR method will involve creating different classes
for slope, TWI, and rainfall depth, and calculating the frequency of each class in historical flood events.
5. Overlay the landslide probability raster map with infrastructure and population data to identify areas with
high flood risk.
6. Visualize the results using QGIS or create reports to present the findings to decision-makers and stakeholders.
