 To assess the flood risk in Kerala using elevation and rainfall data, we can follow this Chain-of-Thought
reasoning:

1. Acquire high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and historical rainfall data for the region of interest
(Kerala).
2. Preprocess the DEM data to remove noise and inconsistencies using WhiteboxTools's Slope, Aspect, Flow
Direction, and Flow Accumulation tools.
3. Calculate hydrologic parameters such as Hillshade, Curvature, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) from the
preprocessed DEM data using WhiteboxTools or QGIS's built-in functions.
4. Interpolate rainfall data using spatial interpolation techniques like Kriging to create a rainfall raster map.
5. Calculate the probability of a landslide occurrence using the Frequency Ratio (FR) method, taking into account
the combined effects of slope, TWI, and rainfall intensity. The FR method will involve creating different classes
for slope, TWI, and rainfall depth, and calculating the frequency of each class in historical flood events.
6. Overlay the landslide probability raster map with infrastructure and population data to identify areas with
high flood risk.
7. Visualize the results using QGIS or create reports to present the findings to decision-makers and stakeholders.
